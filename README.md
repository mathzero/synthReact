## Overview

`synthReact` is an R package designed to generate synthetic datasets that mimic the structure and relationships of data in round 19 of REACT-1. The package uses statistical parameters derived from the REACT data to create realistic synthetic data.

## About the REACT-1 Study

The synthetic data generated by `synthReact` is based on parameters derived from the REACT-1 (Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission) study. REACT-1 is a large-scale epidemiological study conducted in England by Imperial College London, in partnership with Ipsos MORI. The study aimed to track the prevalence and spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, within the general population.

Key aspects of the REACT-1 study:

-   **Regular Testing**: Randomly selected individuals across England were tested regularly to monitor infection rates.
-   **Comprehensive Data Collection**: The study collected a range of data, including demographic information, health status, PCR test results, and more.
-   **Public Health Insights**: Findings from REACT-1 provided insights into COVID-19 transmission dynamics and informed public health interventions.

## Features

-   **Generate Synthetic Data**: Create synthetic datasets with specified sample sizes.
-   **Reproducibility**: Set a seed for random number generation to ensure reproducibility.
-   **Realistic Variable Distributions**: Continuous variables are generated based on real data parameters, and categorical variables reflect actual category probabilities.
-   **Outcome Variables**: Simulate outcome variables (`pcr_test_result` and `longcovid`) based on logistic regression models.
-   **Data Visualization**: Includes functions and examples for visualizing the generated data.
-   **Modeling Examples**: Demonstrates how to fit logistic regression models to the synthetic data.

## Installation

You can install the `synthReact` package from GitHub using the `devtools` package:

``` r
# Install devtools if not already installed
install.packages("devtools")

# Install synthReact from GitHub
devtools::install_github("mathzero/synthReact")
```

## Usage

### Loading the Package

``` r
# Load the synthReact package
library(synthReact)
```

### Generating Synthetic Data

Generate a synthetic dataset with 1,000 samples:

``` r
# Set seed for reproducibility
seed_value <- 123

# Generate synthetic data
n_samples <- 1000
synthetic_data <- generate_synthetic_data(n_samples = n_samples, seed = seed_value)

# View the first few rows
head(synthetic_data)
```

### Synthetic Data Structure

The synthetic dataset includes:

-   **Continuous Variables**:
    -   `age`: Integer between 5 and 100.
    -   `bmi`: Numeric, rounded to one decimal place.
    -   `imd_decile`: Integer between 1 (most deprived) and 10 (least deprived).
    -   `num_comorbidities`: Integer between 0 and 17.
-   **Categorical Variables**:
    -   `smokeever_cat`: Factor; current/former/never/PNA
    -   `region`: Factor; 9 English regions
    -   `work1_healthcare_or_carehome_worker`: Factor; yes/no
    -   `shielding`: Factor; yes/no
     -  `covid_before`: Factor; yes/no
    -   `vaccinated`:  Factor; yes/no
    -   `symptom_loss_smell`: Experienced loss/change of sense of smell in past 7 days. Factor; 1/0
    -   `symptom_loss_taste`: Experienced loss/change of sense of taste in past 7 days. Factor; 1/0
    -   `symptom_cough`: Experienced cough in past 7 days. Factor; 1/0
    -   `symptom_fever`: Experienced fever in past 7 days. Factor; 1/0
-   **Outcome Variables**:
    -   `pcr_test_result`: Binary variable indicating the result of a PCR test.
    -   `longcovid`: Binary variable indicating self-reported Long COVID (defined as symptoms for 4+ weeks).


## Function Reference

### `generate_synthetic_data()`

Generates a synthetic dataset based on parameters from real data.

#### Usage

``` r
generate_synthetic_data(n_samples, seed = NULL)
```

#### Arguments

-   `n_samples`: Integer. Number of samples to generate.
-   `seed`: Integer or `NULL`. Seed for random number generation to ensure reproducibility. Default is `NULL`.

#### Value

A data frame containing the synthetic dataset with variables:

-   **Continuous variables**: `age`, `bmi`, `imd_decile`, `num_comorbidities`.
-   **Categorical variables**: Various factors reflecting original data categories.
-   **Outcome variables**: `pcr_test_result`, `longcovid`.

#### Example

``` r
# Generate synthetic data with 500 samples and a specific seed
synthetic_data <- generate_synthetic_data(n_samples = 500, seed = 42)
```

## Package Details

### Dependencies

The package depends on the following R packages:

-   `MASS`: For multivariate normal distribution functions.
-   `ggplot2`: For data visualization.
-   `dplyr`: For data manipulation.
-   `pROC`: For ROC curve analysis.
-   `corrplot`: For correlation matrix visualization.

### Installation of Dependencies

Install the dependencies using:

``` r
install.packages(c("MASS", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "pROC", "corrplot"))
```
